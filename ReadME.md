## Technical Description of the Assignment  

1. **Documentation Creation with Sphinx**  
   - Use Sphinx to create documentation for your application.  
   - Add docstrings to essential functions and class methods in the main modules.

2. **Unit Testing**  
   - Cover your application‚Äôs repository modules with unit tests.

3. **Integration Testing**  
   - Cover the routes of your application with integration tests using the `pytest` framework.

4. **Test Coverage over 75%**  
   - Ensure your application has over 75% test coverage.  
   - Use the `pytest-cov` package for control.

5. **Caching with Redis**  
   - Implement a caching mechanism using the Redis database.  
   - Cache the current user during authentication so the `get_current_user` function retrieves the user from the cache instead of querying the database each time.

6. **Password Reset Mechanism**  
   - Implement a password reset mechanism for the REST API application.

7. **User Roles and Access**  
   - Implement role-based access for application users: "user" and "admin."  
   - Ensure that only administrators can independently change their default avatar.
